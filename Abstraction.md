# Abstraction

## Information

Abstraction is contract between implementations. It consists of

1. interfaces,
1. structures used by interfaces, 
1. errors that functions in interfaces return,
1. enums/consts.

No logic should be implemented on abstraction level. That means no functions defined on structures used by interfaces.
