# Open Closed Principle

## Information

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is a software design principle that suggests that classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new features or behaviors to your software without changing the existing code.

You should make sure that it is easy to add new functionality without having to modify the existing code. This allows you to add new features or behaviors to your software without introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.

The OCP encourages developers to create code that is easy to maintain and update over time. By following this principle, you will make your code more flexible, modular, and reusable.

[[Dependency Inversion Principle]] describes a way to achive OCP
