# Cohesion

## Information

Cohesion refers to how closely responsibilities of a single module are related to each other. The goal is to have high cohesion, meaning that each module or component should have a single, well-defined responsibility or purpose. High Cohesion applications are easier to maintain, understand, and test because each component does one thing and does it well. "Low [Coupling](https://github.com/vimcki/design-principles/blob/master/Coupling.md), High Cohesion" is often a slogan for good software design.

Aim of [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/vimcki/design-principles/blob/master/Single%20Responsibility%20Principle.md) is to achive high cohesion.
