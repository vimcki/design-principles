# Reusability

## Information

Quality of code that allows it to be used in more than one place. For example ability to deploy multiple applicatioins from the same codebase but for different clients. Deployments differ slightly but core of the application is used in both(reused). Other example might be usage of implementations across multiple applications from the same codebase.

In [Design Principles and Design Patterns](http://staff.cs.utu.fi/~jounsmed/doos_06/material/DesignPrinciplesAndPatterns.pdf) Uncle Bob calls inability to reuse softwer immobility.
