# Ready for Change

## Information

Quality of code that is easy to change in the future. It means that code is:

1. maintainable,
1. easy to understand,
1. easy to extend,
1. easy to refactor.

Focusing on this means that you try to minimise costs of future development and speed at which you can deliver new features.

This is the most important quality.

In [Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) book there its called ETC: Easy to Change.

In [Design Principles and Design Patterns](http://staff.cs.utu.fi/~jounsmed/doos_06/material/DesignPrinciplesAndPatterns.pdf) Uncle Bob writes that changing requirements are the reason that software degrades. Symptoms of rotting design are connected to inability to change or problems while making changes. Symptoms mentioned are: rigidity, fragility, immobility, viscosity.
