# Feature Switch

## Information

Feature switch, also known as feature flag or feature toggle, is a technique in software development that turns certain features of your application on or off at runtime. This enables developers to modify system behavior without changing code, and it is often used for A/B testing, canary releases, or to safely roll out features to specific user groups or environments. Feature switches allow for greater control and risk mitigation during software release processes.
