# Coupling

## Information

Coupling is the degree to which one module relies on another module. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured code. Its achived by using [Abstraction](https://github.com/vimcki/design-principles/blob/master/Abstraction.md) and following [Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/vimcki/design-principles/blob/master/Open%20Closed%20Principle.md). "Low Coupling, High [Cohesion](https://github.com/vimcki/design-principles/blob/master/Cohesion.md)" is often a slogan for good software design.
